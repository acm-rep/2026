As engineers, we are deeply involved in shaping how scientific knowledge is produced, shared, and ultimately judged. In this talk, I’ll reflect on how the so-called reproducibility crisis intersects with a broader erosion of public trust in science, and what that means for those of us who build the tools and pipelines behind the research. Rather than assigning blame or prescribing fixes, this is a call-to-action to consider how openness, communication, and collaboration with users can make our work not only more robust, but more meaningful. The challenges are real, but so is the opportunity to help rebuild confidence in science from the ground up.\nBiography: I am a software engineer by training turned applied statistician in a School of Psychology.

The original dimension is the conventional scientific dimension focused on a question we want to answer. The research practices for addressing such questions are well-understood. The second dimension concerns the authenticity and veracity of data and computation applied to that data. Unfortunately, rather than recognizing this methodological dimension in its own right, we have tried to shoehorn it into existing practices, confusing the key principle underpinning the scientific method. That is, because we think it should be easy to reproduce computational artifacts, we strive for reproducibiity rather than replicability. Perhaps, we have made our jobs harder than we needed to?\nI’ll begin by identifying the challenges we face in computational science, which are even more pronounced in the realm of AI. Then I’ll discuss the confusion around reproduction and replications. Taking a step back, I’ll attempt to derive, from first principles, what we need to properly validate computational experiments, and I’ll conclude with some ideas on a path forward.\nBiography: MARGO I.

expect all community members to act in accordance with these values. Fostering the free exchange of ideas requires building a conference that welcomes people of all backgrounds. Diversity of opinion and background is a fundamental strength of our community. The members of our community must have the freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas. Toward that goal, ACM REP ‘24 aims to create spaces where every participant can express themselves without fear of judgment or harassment.\nThe ACM REP Code of Conduct guides the expected, professional behavior of conference participants, including:\nTreating everyone with respect and consideration; under the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants to be mindful of their speech and behaviors both in person and online. Communicating openly and thoughtfully with others and being considerate of the multitude of views and opinions that may be different than your own. Being respectful and mindful in your critique of ideas. Being mindful of your fellow participants, including (but not limited to): Respecting participants wishes to not be photographed; Respecting participant gender pronouns; and Respecting the space of others and their right to engage or not engage in conversation. We believe differences of opinion are a natural part of social and academic life and are important to work through when building community and learning from one another. At the same time, we acknowledge that societal power structures are even more challenging in academia, which is an inherently hierarchical community. In order to foster an environment of inclusion, we do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or abuse in any form. Participants who engage in harassment may be removed from the conference at the discretion of the organizers.\nUnacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in ACM-REP activities, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of conference activities; offensive, degrading, humiliating, harmful, or prejudicial verbal or written comments or visual images related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, age, appearance, or other personal characteristics; unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal/physical conduct of a sexual nature; inappropriate or gratuitous use of nudity, sexual images, or stereotyped images including using an activity-related communication channel to display or distribute sexually explicit or otherwise offensive or discriminatory images or messages; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; unwelcome and uninvited attention or contact; physical assault (including unwelcome touch or groping); real or implied threat of physical harm; real or implied threat of professional or financial damage or harm. Harassment can occur when there is no deliberate intention to offend. Be careful in the words that you choose. Harassment committed in a joking manner or disguised as a compliment still constitutes unacceptable behavior. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.\nConsequences of Unacceptable Behavior If an ACM-REP participant engages in prohibited behavior, the conference committee reserves the right to take any action the committee deems appropriate, including removing the participant from the conference.\nHow to Report Unacceptable Behavior In the event of unacceptable behavior, participants may wish to inform a person in authority. During ACM REP, participants should reach out to one of the General or Program Chairs (see list below). These individuals can provide information about the process for handling complaints or handling immediate onsite needs.\nThere may be cases (such as those involving Title IX issues in the United States and venue- or employer-specific policies) where an on-site person who is informed of harassment will be required to file a complaint.

The combination of RO-Crates, Bioschemas and schemas.science make resources easy to navigate by machines, provide an unambiguous way for machines to access FAIR metadata and content in a single request, and reduce content-negotiation hassle that can give unpredictable results. This combination is of benefit for researchers and data providers whenever they want to improve FAIRability of their resources as they can support RO-Crate imports and align with Bioschemas specifications, making FAIR-compliant digital objects achievable with existing technologies such as Web Linking over HTTP.\nThe benefits of adopting RO-Crates are evident in a diverse range of applications. For example, Five Safes RO-Crate https://w3id.org/5s-crate/ specifies a profile of RO-Crate for the purpose of workflow execution in a distributed trusted research environment (TRE). The TRE-FX Project (delivered with HDR-UK) is providing safe, federated access to TREs, using the Five Safes RO-Crate standard. Following a Bring Your Own Resource hands-on style, in this tutorial we will showcase how to use RO-Crates, and Bioschemas to improve FAIRability and will accompany attendees to apply the technologies to their own resources.\nWorkflow Mini-Apps: Evaluating Performance Reproducibility in Scientific Workflows When: July 29th 2025, 9am\nWhere: Allard 113, remote presentation\nAuthors: Ozgur Kilic (Brookhaven National Laboratory), Tianle Wang (Brookhaven National Laboratory), Matteo Turilli (Brookhaven National Laboratory), Mikhail Titov (Brookhaven National Laboratory), Andre Merzky (RADICAL-Computing Inc.), Line Pouchard (Sandia National Laboratories), and Shantenu Jha (PPPL, Princeton University)\nAbstract: Scientific workflows have become indispensable for managing complex computational tasks in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. However, their increasing complexity, scale, and heterogeneity often hinder reproducibility. Workflow mini-apps address these challenges by offering simplified yet faithful representations of complex workflows, enabling easier development, testing, and optimization. This three-hour tutorial introduces participants to workflow mini-apps and demonstrates their practical application to enhance reproducibility. The tutorial comprises three main segments:\nIntroduction to Workflow Mini-Apps: Participants will learn what workflow mini-apps are, their role in addressing the reproducibility crisis in scientific computing, and the balance between simplicity and fidelity in their design. Building Workflow Mini-Apps (Interactive Session): Using the wfMiniAPI, an open-source Python and C++ library, participants will interactively construct executable mini-apps. They will learn how to emulate key computational kernels and workflows components, tuning parameters to match performance profiles of original workflows. Executing and Analyzing Mini-Apps (Interactive Session): Participants will run their constructed mini-apps on HPC resources, collect performance metrics, and analyze reproducibility. Hands-on exercises will highlight portability across platforms and demonstrate mini-apps’ utility in capturing essential characteristics of original workflows at a significantly reduced computational cost. This tutorial targets an introductory to intermediate audience familiar with basic Python programming and HPC concepts. By the conclusion, participants will be equipped to leverage workflow mini-apps to simplify the reproducibility and portability challenges of scientific computing workflows, aligning closely with the themes and goals of ACM REP 2025.\nFrom your source code to a reproducible online demonstration When: July 29th 2025, 1:30pm-5pm\nWhere: Allard 121, in-person presentation\nAuthors: Miguel Colom (Centre Borelli, ENS Paris-Saclay)\nAbstract: This is a short hands-on tutorial on how to arrive at a complete reproducible research article, with a special focus on building a complete online demonstration of a particular method. The techniques explained and the recommendations given are general and applicable to any journals or platforms. We’ll focus more on the practical aspects of the source code and the online interface for the online demo. Eventually, the objective of this practical tutorial is to show that many of the recommendations on computation reproducibility have strong reasons why they should be followed, and with the tools that currently exist today it is straightforward to implement them and reach good reproducibility and …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0a88848674f199fc27d42cdcdd983e4c","permalink":"https://acm-rep.github.io/2026/tutorials/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2026/tutorials/","section":"","summary":"Improving FAIRability of your research outcomes with RO-Crates and Bioschemas When: July 29th 2025, 9am\nWhere: Allard 121, in-person presentation\nAuthors: Phil Reed (The University of Manchester) and Abigail Miller (The Jackson Laboratory)","tags":null,"title":"Tutorials","type":"page"}]
